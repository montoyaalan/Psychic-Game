# Word-Guess-Game-
Homework 3

The Word Guess Game, otherwise known as "Hangman" was a very challenging assignment that readdressed our knowledge in HTML and CSS while adding JavaScript into the assignment to make the game function properly. 

I'll admit, I did the Psychic Game first (the easier assignment) but once our deadline was extended I attempted the Hangman assignment. I used many resources on how to create the game such as: YouTube videos, SoloLearn, In-Class Activities, and a personal Tutor recommended from friends. 

The purpose of this assignment was to show our knowledge in Javascript:
-That we understood how arrays and functions work and that we knew how to grab a word at random. 
-That we knew the purpose of "for loops" and how to call upon a function within a function.
-That we knew how to manipulate our HTML file via JS

The main points of this game are as simple as the hangman game itself.
-Selects a movie(word) at random.
-Set a limit on the number of guesses a player has before they lose 
With JS the following was able to be completed:
-Keep number score of wins and loses 
-Keep track of the correct and incorrect letters from the player 
-Display the correct amount of underscores that are in the letters of the movie chosen. 
-Replace the underscores with correct letter guess from player.
-Restart game once player has won or lost 

By far the most difficult assignment but once Javascript is comprehended it is rewarding to see my code work on the screen!

Wish I could've displayed a poster image of the movie once the player lost or won and have a scream sound play but Javascript took more of my time than expected. 

Will go back and add the "nice to haves""
